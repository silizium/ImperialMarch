Imperial March as a bit test for Teensy 3.1

A small tone example to play the demo from 
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-easily-play-music-with-buzzer-on-arduino-Th/
on my Teensy 3.1. Have rewritten all of the code and implemented a small player routine. 

Can be made better, you can put the score into PROGMEM or whatever. It's just a demo to test
my pins.
